// Create annotation Review with two string elements: reviewer and date.
// Element date has default string value today.
// This annotation can be applied to class when we execute static method review(String className) of class Util and the result of this method will be printed Class <ClassName> was reviewed <date in format yyyy-mm-dd> by <reviewer> to standard output (console).
// If the class <className> isnâ€™t annotated we show message: Class <ClassName> isn't marked as Reviewed.
// If the class was not found we show message: Class <ClassName> was not found.
